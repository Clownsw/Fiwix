Fiwix kernel coding standards
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's easier on everyone if all authors working on a shared code base are
consistent in the way they write their programs. Fiwix has the following
conventions in its code:

- Use of snake_case (multi-word names are lower_case_with_underscores) for
  everything except for macro and constant names.

- No space after the name of a function in a call.
  For example, printk("hello") not printk ("hello").

- No space after keywords "if", "for", "while", "switch".
  For example, if(x) not if (x).

- Space before braces (except in function declarations).
  For example, if(x) { not if(x){.

- Space between operands.
  For example, for(n = 0; n < 10; n++), not for(n=0;n<10;n++).

- Beginning-of-line indentation via tabs, not spaces.

- Preprocessor macros are always UPPERCASE.

- Pointer types have spaces: (uint16_t *) not (uint16_t*).

- Comments in code are always as in C89 /* ... */.

- Multiline comments start always with a capital letter and the last sentence
  ends with a period.

- Functions that take no arguments are declared as f(void) not f().

- The open parenthesis is always on the same line as the function name.

- There is never a space between the function name and the open parenthesis.

- There is never a space between the parentheses and the parameters.

- The open curly brace is always at the next line of the function declaration.

- Conditionals should always include curly braces, even if there is only a
  single statement within the conditional.
